# Data Science Dashboard Project

Welcome to the Data Science Dashboard project! This documentation provides an overview of the project's directory structure and guidelines for using the data pipeline with Streamlit to create interactive and insightful data visualizations for non-technical business administrators.

## Using the Data Pipeline with Streamlit

The data pipeline is a crucial component of your data science dashboard project, responsible for processing and transforming raw data into insights that drive your visualizations and analyses. Follow these steps to effectively utilize the data pipeline along with Streamlit, a user-friendly Python library for creating interactive web applications:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Place your raw data files (e.g., CSV, Excel) in the `data/raw_data/` directory.
   - Ensure that your raw data adheres to the expected format.

2. **Configuration**:
   - Modify the `config.yml` file in the `src/` directory to specify configuration settings, such as data sources and processing options.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Utilize the `transform.ipynb` notebook in the `src/` directory to perform data transformation tasks.
   - Implement data cleaning, feature engineering, and other necessary manipulations within this notebook.
   - Execute the notebook to generate processed data files, which will be saved in the `data/processed_data/` directory.

4. **Dashboard Implementation with Streamlit**:
   - Work with the `dashboard.py` file in the `src/` directory to build and customize your data science dashboard using Streamlit.
   - Streamlit is a powerful Python library that simplifies the creation of interactive web applications for data visualization and analysis.
   - Leverage the Streamlit utilities provided in the `datasci_dash/` package to create dynamic and user-friendly visualizations and interfaces.
   - Configure your dashboard components, layout, and interactivity based on your specific requirements.

5. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write unit tests using the `tests/` directory to ensure the correctness of your dashboard components and data processing steps.
   - Use the `test_streamlit.py` file to test Streamlit components and the `test_pipeline.py` file for data processing tests.

6. **Execution and Deployment**:
   - Run your data science dashboard by executing the `streamlit run src/dashboard.py` command in your terminal.
   - Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed, as specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
   - Deploy your dashboard to your desired platform or share it with your target audience.

By following this structured approach and harnessing the capabilities of Streamlit, you can efficiently manage your data pipeline, create insightful visualizations, and deliver valuable insights to your non-technical business administrators.
